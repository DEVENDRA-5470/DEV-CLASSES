    Formula:  
    `c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`

16. Solve for the slope of a line.  
    Formula:  
    `Slope (m) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)`

17. Calculate the area of a triangle.  
    Formula:  
    `Area = 1/2 * base * height`

18. Calculate the circumference of a circle.  
    Formula:  
    `Circumference = 2 * pi * r`

19. Find the distance between two points.  
    Formula:  
    `Distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`

20. Calculate profit.  
    Formula:  
    `Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price`

21. Calculate loss.  
    Formula:  
    `Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price`

22. Calculate profit percentage.  
    Formula:  
    `Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100`
