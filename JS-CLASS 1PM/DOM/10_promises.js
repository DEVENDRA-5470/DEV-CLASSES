// A promise in javascript is like a guarantee that something will happen
// in the future.
// It represents a task (like getting data from a server) that is happening
// in the background.

// A Promise Can have three phases:
// 1.Pending : it will waiting to finish.
// 2.Resloved(Fullfilled) : The task completed sucessfully.
// 3.Reject  : The task failed.


// Think of it as ordering food at a restaurant :
// 1.You place your order (Promise is created).
// 2.While you wait other things can happen (Promise is pending).
// 3.You get your food (the promise is fullfilled) Or something goes wrong (the promise is rejected).

// You can use .then() to do something when the promise fullfilled.
// and .catch() to handle errors if the promise rejected.
